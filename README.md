 # index.html 
broken links that needed to be corrected. 
    Ex: the Horiseon was broken up and needed to be all one word.
I did replace the <div> with different tags to express the sections better. 
Had to add an id for search engine optimization for the link to work
in the footer tag, i switched <h2> to <h4>

# Style.css
replaced div to the new tags. 
took the "." out since all the sections are tagged differently
took out the repeated code and changed the tags
changed footer h4
